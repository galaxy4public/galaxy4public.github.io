	<title>Mind Drops :: Building a firewall? Simple and easy!</title>
	<meta name="description" content="This post advocates for building simple, elegant, and secure firewall rulesets, arguing that overly complex configurations are difficult to manage and audit. The author suggests that most firewall needs can be met with fewer than 20 well-defined rules by focusing on four key prerequisites: understanding networking fundamentals, mapping traffic flows with diagrams, clearly defining firewall goals (e.g., allowing inbound access and restricting outbound), and knowing the specific firewall toolset, like iptables. A real-world example is provided with a 13-rule iptables configuration for a NAT gateway, which establishes a default-deny policy for incoming traffic while allowing established connections, essential ICMP traffic, and specific services like SSH, demonstrating that a secure and effective firewall doesn’t need to be convoluted." />

				<p>I strive for simplicity since I am a strong believer that achieving a goal with
the most simplest solution looks elegant, proves that you have deep knowledge
on the subject, and overall is beautiful by itself.  Additionally to this, a
simple solution is easier to comprehend and to audit, hence it is much easier
to ensure the security of such a solution.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, I stumbled upon numerous complicated firewalls erected on
the NAT boxes with tens (sometimes, hundreds!) of rules describing the traffic
flows and punched holes for some edge cases.  Every time I wondered: what kind
of a bug has bitten the person who composed such a convoluted ruleset that is a
nightmare to manage?</p>
<p>In 99% of the cases, I was able to come up with a ruleset of usually less than
20 rules for the whole firewall to achieve exactly the same result.  So, in
this article I will explain my approach on building firewalls that are easy to
support and to understand.</p>
<p>Before you dive into optimising (or creating) your firewall, there are some
things you need to have a clear understanding of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Networking</p>
<p>You do not need to be an expert or a guru, but you should know fundamentals
about the protocols, standards, and internals of the networking related to
the area you are going to secure with the firewall.</p>
<p>When you are in doubt, do not rely on an assumption: use search engines and
locate the corresponding RFC, standard, and/or any other authoritative
source of information documenting the protocol you are working with.</p>
<p>It is impossible to know everything, but the common fallacy is that people
often create things based on wrong assumptions when it was a couple of
clicks away to research and understand the subject.  I have seen so many
times when people are &ldquo;designing&rdquo; their firewalls without a slightest clue
in regard to the standards covering interoperability of the hosts in the IP
network.</p>
<p>For example, you can easily spot these &ldquo;creations&rdquo; if you look at the
ruleset and see that there is a rule that drops ICMP packets
unconditionally (or do not define any rules dealing with ICMP when the
default policy is &ldquo;deny&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traffic flows</p>
<p>Think of a firewall as a filter that manages traffic flows (Figure 1 shows
a good visual representation of how traffic passes through the Linux
netfilter subsystem).</p>
<p>Before you can make a decision in regard to whether to allow or deny
something you must know what your are dealing with and what outcome you
want to achieve.</p>
<p>It would tremendously help you later if you could simply draw a diagram of
your network and overlay it with a layer documenting the inbound and
outbound flows of each node on the diagram.  Such a &ldquo;data flow&rdquo; diagram is
supposed to be a part of any solution documentation involving network
infrastructure, but in reality most of the enterprises (at least the ones I
worked with) simply forget to generate one.</p>
<p>On such a diagram you would be able to see straight away what kind of
legitimate traffic is going to cross your firewall and what traffic is not
supposed to reach your firewall at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>This may sound obvious, but one of the most important things is to know
exactly what you are trying to achieve.  You are not building a firewall for
the sake of building a firewall, are you?</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, there are just a handful number of scenarios for creating
a firewall (I fail to come up with more than five at this point) and all of
them are very simple.</p>
<p>If your network provides any services to the external network (e.g.
Internet) there are just two options I can think of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow external entities to access services on defined public endpoints
   (an inbound flow) and allow unrestricted outbound traffic from your
   network to the external one (an outbound flow);</li>
<li>Allow external entities to access services on defined public endpoints
   and restrict outbound traffic from your network to a defined set of
   external endpoints.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your network does not provide any services to the external network and
only consumes resources from it, I see only two options:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Disallow any access from the external entities to your resources, but
   allow your network to access the external endpoints and receive
   responses from there;</li>
<li>The same as above, but restrict the outbound traffic to a selected set
   of the external endpoints.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fifth scenario is the one I personally do not use and is the blacklist
approach:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>allow everything in each direction and block communication for the
   specific endpoints only (be they external and/or internal).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>Last, but not least, is the requirement to know the corresponding toolset
you are going to utilise to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>There are numerous high-level frameworks which are supposed to make systems
administrator&rsquo;s life easier (e.g.  RHEL/CentOS/Fedora are using firewalld
on top of iptables), however, personally I prefer to work with iptables
directly (thus, my systems do not have firewalld installed).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you start implementing the rules it often helps to describe your
firewall ruleset in simple sentences, e.g.:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>deny any incoming traffic to our network through the firewall unless it is
     explicitly allowed by the rules;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow any outbound traffic from our network through the firewall unless it
     is explicitly denied by the rules;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deny any forwarding of traffic through the firewall unless it is
     explicitly allowed by the rules;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow anyone on the Internet to connect to the webserver on ports 80/tcp
     and 443/tcp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow our office to connect to the firewall via SSH on port 22/tcp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow traffic from our network to pass the firewall toward the Internet;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow the back channel traffic from the resources on the Internet to our
     network;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And then research how each of these sentences can be implemented using the
configuration language of the tool.  The point here is that you need to take
one step at a time and translate the logic exactly so you do not deviate from
your goals &ndash; you will be able to optimise the result at a later stage.</p>
<p>Well, it is time for a real world example, I guess.  The following snippet is
used as the skeleton for the iptables ruleset on systems I manage (this snippet
assumes that 192.168.0.0/16 is the internal network and that the ruleset is
installed on the NAT instance which is a gateway to the Internet):</p>

<p>There are a few things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>default policies for INPUT and FORWARD are set to ACCEPT while the last
    rule in each chain is set to REJECT.  The reason for this is that the
    default policy can be either ACCEPT or DROP with the latter silently
    dropping packets.  Dropping packets makes it hard to investigate network
    issues, hence I prefer REJECT instead.</li></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you need to open more ports the best place to insert your rules would be
    between SSH and DHCP rules in the INPUT chain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are setting up a firewall on the server (so no traffic forwarding is
    needed) you may want to either drop all rules from the FORWARD chain and
    set the default policy for that chain to DROP, or you can simply leave the
    last two rules (LOG and REJECT) in the chain removing the rest.  Also, the
    nat table is not needed on the servers, so should be omitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the above ruleset is not strict enough in regard to filtering ICMP traffic
    and allows all types of ICMP, perhaps it could be further tightened to
    allow only ICMP types 0 (reply), 3 (destination unreachable), 8 (request),
    11 (time exceeded), and 30 (traceroute) to pass through the firewall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, here you have it a solid firewall ruleset consisting of just 13 rules.</p>
