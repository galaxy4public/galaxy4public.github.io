of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
essential purpose.</p>
<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of
liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the
above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party&rsquo;s liability will
be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h2 id="as-is-and-as-available-disclaimer">&ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; and &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Service is provided to You &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; and &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; and with all faults

undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or
limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the

greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
