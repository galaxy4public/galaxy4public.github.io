<p>Dmitry D. Khlebnikov is an independent Information Technology professional who
helps businesses achieve their objectives without compromise on security.</p>
<p>Dmitry believes that software engineering should be driven by applying
principles of science and mathematics to deliver economical yet robust
solutions to technical problems challenging business objectives.</p>
<p>Over more than two decades of his professional life, Dmitry acquired deep
knowledge in multiple domains starting with low level networking, operating
systems, and principles of modern computing architecture and expanding to
adjacent areas of Information Technology as user experience design, business
modelling, etc.</p>
<p><img alt="MTUCI Logo" class="figure" height="80" src="https://dmitry.khlebnikov.net/images/mtuci-logo.png" title="Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics">
Dmitry holds a master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science from the Moscow Technical
University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI) and is a certified
Software Engineer.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Dmitry D. Khlebnikov was born in Moscow, Russia.  His passion for computers was
ignited by his father who introduced Dmitry to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ES_PEVM">ES-1840</a>, one of the first
Soviet clones of IBM PC at the age of nine.  Dmitry was spending all weekends
at his father&rsquo;s work place just to get an opportunity to play some basic games
and to explore the technology.</p>
<p>Seeing the interest his son had in technology and the lack of formal computer
education programmes in Russia at the time, Dmitry&rsquo;s father seized the
opportunity to send Dmitry to a summer camp which was sponsored by newly born
businessmen of Russia to educate teenagers in computer literacy.  A significant
part of curriculum was concentrated around programming using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal#Version_5.5">Borland Turbo
Pascal 5.5</a> and to this day Dmitry is confident that it was a pivotal
milestone in his life.</p>
<p>The lack of good documentation and scarcity of available software pushed
Dmitry to discover Russian computer underground and demoscene.  The subculture
was in its golden age where information sharing was the uniting foundation and
multiple groups were competing with each other to showcase their superior
understanding of technology.  At some point at that time, once he was quite
confident in his assembler, C/C++, and reverse engineering skills, Dmitry
organised his own group that was focused primarily on releasing save game
editors and runtime game modifications.</p>
<p>The downside of such a commitment to underground society was that Dmitry&rsquo;s
normal &ldquo;social&rdquo; life started to deteriorate: he was expelled from four schools
and decided not to pursue graduating from high school and focus on improving
his coding skills instead.</p>
<p>In 1995, Dmitry discovered IBM OS/2 operating system and for the next three
years Dmitry was learning all the intricacies of what subjectively was <q>the
best desktop operating system for a nerd</q> at the time: it was truly object
oriented (starting with Warp 4.0), was bundled with Java and speech recognition
software, etc. With new technologies new challenges have arisen, so have the
opportunities: Dmitry learnt how to reverse engineer multithreaded applications,
exploit local race condition in a multitasking system, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Another thing that happened in 1995 in Dmitry&rsquo;s life is the first exposure to
the Internet via a dial-up connection.  There, Dmitry unearthed a huge world
of clever people from all around the globe and was obsessed with absorbing as
much knowledge as he physically could.</p>
<p>In June of 1998, a friend brought a CD-ROM containing a fresh Linux
distribution of Red Hat Linux 5.1 (Manhattan) and from that point on Linux
became Dmitry&rsquo;s primary operating system.  This and the discovery of the
Open Source community set the future course of Dmitry&rsquo;s life for the next
couple of decades.</p>
<h2 id="professional-career-russia">Professional Career (Russia)</h2>
<p>Dmitry&rsquo;s work career started early, at the age of seventeen, due to dropping
out of school and living independently from his parents.</p>
<p>As a minor with the desire to work in IT, Dmitry chose to get some experience
at his father&rsquo;s company first (one branch of which was designated to import
laptops and other computer peripherals and retail them).  There was a need to
research on the new arrivals and provide advice to the sales manager so they
could better do their job.  It fitted Dmitry&rsquo;s keen interest to learn new
technology perfectly, since he was getting access to the latest devices on the
local market and was paid for playing with them.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to Dmitry, he also learnt how retail business operates, what drives
it, and the importance of human communication to achieve business targets.</p>
<p>In October of 1997, Dmitry was hired as a Client Support Manager by an American
Company (SequoIa Computers).  The company specialised in providing managed
services to western companies operating in Moscow.  Although it came with a
stiff learning curve, the position gave the opportunity to work with hardware
and in places Dmitry could only dream of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IBM AS/400 and the token ring at the Maersk office</p>
<p>Since Novell Netware Server was the primary product SequoIa was promoting
to its clients. Dmitry was tasked to &ldquo;marry&rdquo; two technologies before the
company would officially give up on the contract.  After several days of
brainstorming on &ldquo;how to fit the IPX stack and token ring drivers in 640KB
and yet have some memory to run Windows 3.11&rdquo; a solution was found and
implemented, thanks for extensive reverse engineering experience Dmitry
had to that point in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple LocalTalk networking stack at the BP office</p>
<p>It was a unique experience for a young professional like Dmitry, starting
with an unusual network configuration &ndash; the client was using Farallon
EtherWave adapters to build a daisy-chain ethernet based network with no
hub or concentrator required; learning physical access control systems,
since the office was equipped with the state of the art physical security
mechanisms; and, finally, discovering an internal intranet for IT people
of BP running on the X.25 protocol and connecting all offices worldwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COMPAQ ProLiant Servers and TCP/IP stack at the Latham &amp; Wattkins office</p>
<p>That was another emergency call to help out a fellow support manager,
when the network went down on December 31, so Dmitry was brought in to
assess an fix the network he never seen before built on the technology
he was not familiar with.  The story ended with a success after spending
the New Year night studying the network and locating a part of the damaged
ethernet cable that was causing extreme collision levels in the rest of the
network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite being quite happy with the opportunities, after an year of working on
average 80 hours per week due to high demand, Dmitry burnt out and left the
company despite the management offering double salary to stay, which was
extraordinary amount of money for Moscow at the time, let alone for a twenty
years old.</p>
<p>After half an year break, Dmitry decided to try to do the same job again.  This
time with a focus on his mental and physical well-being to avoid the burn out
situation he experienced before.  He joined quite a big Russian software
development company, Intellect-Service, whose primary product was an accounting
software suite, hence they needed quite a big customer support department to
support the deployment and to maintain the software at clients&rsquo; offices.  Over
the next fifteen months Dmitry was honing his networking and troubleshooting
skills.  At the same time the company provided high speed (128Kbps) Internet
connectivity in their offices, which meant that Dmitry had the opportunity to
access the net during calm periods of time when he was waiting for the next
assignment.</p>
<p>Although trying to negotiate hard, Dmitry only managed to get an entry level
salary at the new place at first which was attributed to lack of formal
education.  It took him almost five months to prove his knowledge and skills
to get an adequate pay rise and the promotion to match his skill set.  To avoid
such a situation in the future, Dmitry enrolled into the Moscow Technical
University of Communications and Informatics (and graduated six years later
with the Master of Computer Science degree).</p>
<p>In May of 2000, Dmitry together with two partners attempt to start their own
business: a small Internet Service Provider (ISP) in a remote district just
outside Moscow.  Dmitry&rsquo;s skills of building networks and architectural
knowledge were invaluable for the new venture.  The company grew from just
three people running around, laying cables, and doing all other stuff to a
workforce of 50+ with more than 1,300 customers in three years.</p>
<p>As the company grew it required more delegation and management than technical
excellence, but at that time Dmitry did not possess neither skill, so he sold
his share to his business partners and continued his pursuit of mastering
technical skills at one of the established Moscow ISPs (DataForce IP), where he
found a few people worth learning from.</p>
<p>At DataForce, Dmitry met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Designer">Alexander Peslyak</a> (better known as Solar
Designer) and realised that they crossed paths multiple times in the virtual
space of the Russian computer underground community, but this was the first
time they met face to face.</p>
<p>Alexander introduced Dmitry to a project under the Openwall Project umbrella
where an American company wanted to have their own version of a Linux
distribution based on Openwall GNU/*/Linux, but which should be binary
compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  Dmitry become the leading
developer/packager for that time and brought the majority of compatibility changes
to the codebase which resulted in the release of Openwall GNU/*/Linux 2.0 (and
the delivery of the custom Linux distribution to the client).</p>
<p>The work on the Openwall Project demonstrated skills and commitment Dmitry was
putting in and as the consequence Openwall, Inc. was registered to provide managed
hosting services to primarily US companies (among other things like security
consulting, etc.).  Dmitry left DataForce IP and became full time contractor at
the newly formed company, where he was designing and implementing secure mass
virtual hosting environments.</p>
<p>Through Openwall, Inc., Dmitry learnt how to tap into and leverage multiple
domains of knowledge and be a subject matter expert in a variety of fields,
since work required him to be an Infrastructure Architect, a Security Expert, a
Developer, a Systems Administrator, and a Principal Engineer &ndash; often a
combination of these at the same time. </p>
<h2 id="professional-career-australia">Professional Career (Australia)</h2>
<p>In September of 2008, Dmitry with his wife and daughter migrated to Melbourne,
Australia.</p>
<p>With the blessings of Alexander to use the Openwall name Dmitry registered an
Australian branch of the company, Openwall Pty Ltd, and acquired his first
local client (SMS Central).</p>
