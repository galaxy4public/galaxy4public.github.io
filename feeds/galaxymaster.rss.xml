&lt;p&gt;Each time I get a new Samsung phone I have to figure out a way to change the
Country Service Code (CSC) to a country that allows automated call recordings,
for example, Indonesia (XID).  Previously, approximately 5 years ago, it was
quite straight forward: you needed to download the HOME_CSC image for the
region you are interested in, ensure that it was for the same bootloader
version, and flash it to the CSC partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, something changed in recent years (and I was not paying attention to …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">(GalaxyMaster)</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 15:30:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>tag:dmitry.khlebnikov.net,2025-10-09:/2025/10/09/samsung-csc-change-using-modem-commands/</guid><category>hacks</category><category>hacks</category><category>howto</category><category>console</category></item><item><title>macOS builtin VPN client tricks</title><link>https://dmitry.khlebnikov.net/2022/11/25/macos-builtin-vpn-client-tricks/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I think everyone would agree that when it comes to the VPN configuration macOS
builtin VPN client lacks any flexibility and its GUI exposes a fraction of
supported features.  This is one of the reasons why there are so many third
party VPN clients for macOS in the world, I believe.  However, I found that the
majority of the time I can get away by using the standard macOS VPN client to
connect to the desired VPN endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

found that either people consider &amp;ldquo;responsive&amp;rdquo; to be something else or that it
is a non-trivial problem to solve.  In any case, I decided to have a crack at
it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My definition of a responsive pagination widget is pretty simple: such a widget
should maintain its look and feel when the viewport (or a window) changes the
size, yet the excessive information such as page numbers in the middle should
be omitted if there is no space for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I started my journey with the definition of what I really wanted to

&lt;p&gt;My blog heavily relies on me sharing session dumps and file excerpts using the

nginx which was achieved by quite an intrusive patch to the core nginx module.
The patch was invented a while ago and was working very well up until recent
nginx versions were released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of nginx 1.10 it was noticed that the patch crashes some
workers under heavy load and this was unacceptable for the production load,
hence a new approach was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of the new solution is that it is non-intrusive and works with any
services that communicate via sockets.&lt;/p&gt;

The patch implements a resolve keyword compatible with the commercial NGINX version, ensuring seamless configuration if a user decides to upgrade.

described a technique on how one could jump quite effortlessly through a chain
of intermediate hosts. However, there was a catch: the user names and ports
across the whole chain should be the same and there was no easy way to change
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I &lt;a href="https://dmitry.khlebnikov.net/2016/07/25/ssh-interactive-proxycommand/"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; paid quite a lot of attention to the ProxyCommand

attempt to build an enterprise level authentication framework for SSH
authentication using the SSH &lt;abbr title="Certificate Authority"&gt;CA&lt;/abbr&gt; feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is based on a wrapper script that signs a user via a &lt;abbr title="Security Assertion Markup Language"&gt;SAML&lt;/abbr&gt; identity
provider and gets user&amp;rsquo;s public key signed for the further usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the discussions I pointed out that such a wrapper script is not good
